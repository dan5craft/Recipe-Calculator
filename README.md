This program has been made to easily calculate the different recipes in video games like minecraft, and it has a few features:
- Ability to add items with or without recipes.
- Ability to edit items.
- Ability to calculate an amount of all the recipes added.
- Ability to tell the program what items you already are stocked up on so it won't tell you how to craft them.
- Ability to delete items added.
- Ability to sort the item list.

With these features it will be easy to know what you need to make x amount of y, and it will tell you the raw materials and all the things you need to craft.
Right now it already contains a json file that has a lot of items from gregtech new horizons, so you may use that if you will.
