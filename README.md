This program has been made to easily calculate the different recipes in video games like minecraft, and it has a few features:
- Ability to add items with or without recipes.
- Ability to edit items.
- Ability to calculate an amount of all the recipes added.
- Ability to tell the program what items you already are stocked up on so it won't tell you how to craft them.
- Ability to delete items added.
- Ability to sort the item list.

With these features it will be easy to know what you need to make x amount of y, and it will tell you the raw materials and all the things you need to craft.
Right now it already contains a json file that has a lot of items from gregtech new horizons, so you may use that if you will.

# Instructions
## To open the program
Either use the Recipe calculator.py file with python installed, or go into the dist folder and use the Recipe calculator.exe.
Keep in mind that the json files have to be in the same folder as the program you are using.

## To use the program
First it will ask you what the name of the json file is, if you don't have one, then type the name you wanna give a new json file, and create it.
Then once inside the program you can freely choose what to do.
(If you just created a json file you would probably want to add items)
To clear stocked items simply don't write anything when changing it.

There really isn't anymore to tell that you wouldn't just probably figure out by yourself lol.
